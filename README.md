# 🛒 Amazon Product Card Clone

This project is a **pixel-perfect clone** of a product listing card on Amazon, built using only **HTML** and **CSS**. The card displays key product details including an image, title, rating, pricing, shipping info, and an add-to-cart button — closely mimicking the real Amazon UI.

---

## ✅ Objective

To recreate a responsive and visually accurate Amazon product card using fundamental front-end web technologies — no frameworks or JavaScript involved.

## 🧠 Solution & Approach

### 🎯 Design Goal
Replicate the design shown in the reference image [here](https://bit.ly/3HLbKVQ), focusing on:
- Visual alignment
- Font usage and colors
- Button styling
- Responsiveness and clarity

### 🧩 Our Approach

1. **Image First Layout**:
   - Product image displayed at the top of the card.
   - Sized proportionally and made responsive.

2. **Content Sections**:
   - **Product title** styled to match font weight and color.
   - **Star ratings** created using Unicode stars with Font Awesome support for the dropdown chevron.
   - **Review count** and **"bought in past month"** text styled subtly.
   - **Price formatting** broken into dollars and cents using separate `<span>`s for better control.
   - **Shipping info** including a second line using `<br>` for separation.

3. **Call to Action**:
   - A bright, Amazon-style yellow “Add to Cart” button.
   - Styled with border radius, hover effect, and bold font.

4. **Responsive Structure**:
   - All elements are wrapped inside a `.card` container.
   - CSS `flexbox` is used for aligning the rating stars, review count, and dropdown arrow.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Font Awesome** for the dropdown arrow (`fas fa-chevron-down`)
- **No JavaScript or frameworks used** — 100% pure frontend
